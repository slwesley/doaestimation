function M = findula(w)
% FINDULA Returns the extreme central ULA position for any co-array.

% *Variables Description:*

% Obtain extreme central co-array ULA position
% In case of Nested Arrays, there is no holes. So, the variable M is equal
% to the extreme position of the co-array. However, in case of co-prime
% arrays, that is not true and then we have to find the entral co-array
% ULA.

M = (length(w)-1)/2;
for i=(M+2):(2*M+1)
    if w(i)==0
        M = i-(M+2);
        break;
    end
